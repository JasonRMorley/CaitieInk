I spent the first part of the day trying to finish the booking system. i had trouble with accessing the data needed.
in the client service, i had to get retrieve client profile then tap into client.tattoos.bookings.
quite a clunky way to get the data i needed so after much faf, i decided to refactor the project.
i have renamed some tables, renamed and inserted some columns as well as set up new relationships between the models.
repository became client repository again. there is also a bookings repository.
There are now client service and booking service.
there are new vm classes so the bookings table can show client name  that are associated with the booking.
the bookingform has been updated and the booking system fixed. user can now view bookings on the bookings page.
